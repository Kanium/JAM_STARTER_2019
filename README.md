# Kanium_challenge_2019
A gamejam sort of development challenge/workshop to learn to use Unity. Maybe just use it for motivation to get started with unity.

### Instructions (for windows users. other users: figure it out)

> 1. Download unity hub(**recommended**) [from here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
> 1.1 Install unity hub

Some older docs for unity hub [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Z9lsSVKfrr4agsquOlUs5s1wlfK7Kng95hLQovGDfk/edit), should still apply except its easier now. You dont need these necessarily. Its easy.

> 1.2 Install a unity version through hub ( Installs -> Official )
> (preferably get a 2018.3.x, they are pretty compatible, current is 2018.3.12f)
> UPDATE: They just published 2019.1.0f2, we'll stick with 2018.3.x still.

**TO BE CONTINUED... soon**
